  "Assign a tracked agent run to a work target.

  Assignment is an agent operation: it accepts a published ready run that
  `serves` the target, freezes named policy prose into durable context, and
  writes a work prompt. It does not claim the target, create a worktree, add a
  `depends-on` from the run to the card, or close anything when the process
  exits.

  Launch eligibility is separate from acceptance. A blocked target may be
  accepted; scheduling must consult `target-ready?` before starting the
  worker."
