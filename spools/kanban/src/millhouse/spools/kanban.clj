(ns millhouse.spools.kanban
  "User-facing kanban board over Millstrand strands.

  Cards are the user<->agent tracking surface: everything a user asks for is a
  `feature` card (occasionally grouped under an `epic`), and every agent
  working directly with a user works under a claimed card. All card state
  lives under `kanban/*` attributes; `kanban/lane` is the active board lane
  (`refinement` -> `pending` -> `claimed` -> `in_review`) and `kanban/outcome`
  records a finished card's outcome. The
  `kanban/priority` (p1 immediate blocker .. p4 someday, default p3) orders
  lanes and `kanban next`.

  Cards are work roots: claiming stamps `owner`/`branch`/`worktree`, and
  execution strands hang beneath the card with `parent-of` edges — the kanban
  spool complements the engines that produce them, it does not replace them.
  Notes are closed note strands on cards and tasks; progress notes belong on
  the doing-task, so a cold agent self-discovers in-flight work with
  `kanban board` -> `kanban card <id>` -> the doing-task and its
  `latest-note`."

    |Kanban cards are the user-to-agent work board. Every card is a feature by default;
    |an epic is a grouping card whose direct feature children use parent-of. Active cards
    |move through refinement (awaiting explicit promote), pending (the actionable queue),
    |claimed, and in_review before finish closes them with an explicit outcome. Epics are
    |never claimed: finish them from refinement or pending; done requires closed feature
    |children, while abandoned reversibly closes still-open children.
    |
    |Priority p1 is an immediate blocker, p2 is high value, p3 is the default, and p4 is
    |someday work. `kanban next` returns the highest-priority pending feature, oldest
    |first within its priority. A claim stamps owner and branch, plus worktree when one
    |exists; run-id is an optional opaque workflow pointer. Card state lives in
    |kanban/card, kanban/type, kanban/lane, kanban/outcome, kanban/priority,
    |kanban/source, kanban/task, kanban/run-id, and kanban/abandon-restore-lane.
    |Labels are open kanban.label/<slug>=true markers rather than a fixed vocabulary.
    |
    |Kanban owns board projections and guarded card transitions: add, board, card, next,
    |priority, label, promote, claim, task, note, review, rework, finish, and reopen.
    |`kanban-batch` atomically creates pending feature cards from items with key, title,
    |optional body and priority, and sibling-key or durable-id depends-on references.
    |Use Batteries add, update, note, list, ready, show, query, and weave for the generic
    |graph behavior they already name. Run `strand help kanban` for exact invocation,
    |`strand prime kanban` for working discipline, and `strand pattern explain
    |kanban-batch` for the live batch contract."))

    |Start with `strand help kanban`, then inspect `strand pattern explain kanban-batch`
    |and the kanban queries through `strand query list` and `strand query explain <name>`.
    |Every direct user request is a feature card; group related cards under an epic only
    |when that grouping is useful. Half-formed ideas belong in refinement and require an
    |explicit promote. Every agent doing direct user work works under a claimed feature
    |card: claim the pending card with owner and branch before starting.
    |
    |Before execution, decompose the feature into tasks. Tasks are the driveable slices;
    |the card remains the audit root, and depends-on edges define the concurrency DAG.
    |Put other execution work beneath the card with Batteries add and update, and relate
    |blockers with depends-on.
    |
    |Record decisions, progress, and gotchas as they happen on the task being driven; its
    |latest note is the resume read. Keep card notes to lean handover summaries, and put
    |review findings or command output on a task note rather than the card. Every branch
    |has exactly one active work root stamped with branch and owner (and worktree when it
    |exists); its children inherit that context through parent-of.
    |
    |Use `strand weave --pattern kanban-batch` for atomic backlog creation and `strand
    |list` or `strand ready` with the registered kanban queries for generic selection.
