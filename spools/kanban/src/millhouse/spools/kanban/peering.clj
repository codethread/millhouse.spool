  "Opt-in board peering: the RECEIVE guild op plus the SEND-side local ops.

  A trusted-config module activates this namespace after the guild and kanban
  modules. Static forms publish the two local operations, and a named lifecycle
  resource registers the Guild receiver; the prerequisites fail loudly when
  missing:

  - `kanban.send.v1` — the guild receive op. A sibling weaver drops a card, or
    an epic bundle, onto this board. Received cards travel the same
    `millhouse.spools.kanban/add!` code path as local cards, so defaults, lanes, and
    epic `parent-of` wiring are identical; `:from` provenance is stamped as one
    `kanban/from` attribute. Guild parses the op's single JSON argument to a
    keyword-keyed map at `:guild/input`, so `::send-input` specs keyword keys
    throughout.
  - `kanban-peers` — list sibling weavers and, for each running one, whether it
    advertises `kanban.send.v1` (so a caller knows where a card can be sent).
  - `kanban-send` — resolve a local card and mirror the board tier onto a peer's
    board over `kanban.send.v1`.

  The two peering seams onto sibling weavers — enumerate/probe and invoke — go
  through `millstrand.api.peers.alpha` behind `*list-peers*`, `*list-peer-guild*`, and
  `*send-card*` so classification and payload building are testable without a
  live socket peer."
